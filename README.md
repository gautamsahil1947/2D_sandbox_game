It's about a boy who is stuck in a zombie world. 
The zombies use phones all the time. 
The boy too was a zombie, but the moment he realised it, he set out a journey seeking wisdom. 
This is his journey

At the end, he seeks the wisdom to not end up like those zombies,
and maybe help them become humans too.


the game uses procedural generation of terrain, or so I want it to use.
